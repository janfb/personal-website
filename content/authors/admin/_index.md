I am a PhD student with [Jakob Macke](https://www.mackelab.org) at University of Tübingen working on the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. 
I have a background in Cognitive Science and in Computational Neuroscience and discovered my passion for Bayesian statistics new and machine learning during my masters. 
Now I am developing probabilistic machine learning tools and apply them to problems in computational neuroscience. 

My research focus lies on simulation-based inference (SBI), a method to perform Bayesian inference in computational models for which standard approximate inference methods like _MCMC_ or _VI_ do not work. 
I am one of the core developers of [_sbi_](https://www.mackelab.org/sbi), a Python toolbox for SBI that has gained a lot of attention over last years (used in >40 publications, >260 stars on GitHub).
