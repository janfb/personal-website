I am a PhD student with Jakob Macke at TU Munich and University of Tübingen. Building on a background in Cognitive Science (BSc at University of Osnabrück) and Computational Neuroscience (MSc at TU Berlin) I am now developing probabilistic machine learning tools for science and applying them to neuroscience.
